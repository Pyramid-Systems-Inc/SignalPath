I've created a comprehensive development plan to implement the full-featured SignalPath Intercom Designer using the Blazor + Tauri technology stack. The plan addresses the significant discrepancy between the sophisticated Electron + React application described in the README and the basic Blazor + Tauri implementation currently in place.

The plan includes:

1. **Technology Stack Migration**: A clear transition path from Electron + React to Blazor + Tauri while maintaining all sophisticated features.

2. **Key Architecture Decisions**: Strategic choices for Blazor WebAssembly (over Hybrid), custom Canvas rendering via JS Interop, and C# singleton state management.

3. **Detailed Implementation Plan**: A 5-phase approach spanning 14-19 weeks:
   - Phase 1: Foundation and Layout (2-3 weeks)
   - Phase 2: Component System (3-4 weeks)
   - Phase 3: Interaction System (4-5 weeks)
   - Phase 4: Advanced Features (3-4 weeks)
   - Phase 5: Polish and Deployment (2-3 weeks)

4. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Proactive approaches to address technology migration, timeline, and quality assurance risks.

5. **Success Metrics**: Clear technical and user experience metrics to measure project success.

The plan provides a complete roadmap for transforming the current basic implementation into a professional-grade schematic design tool with all the features described in the README, including advanced wire routing, component management, and real-time interaction capabilities.
