## Conclusion
SignalPath has a solid architectural foundation with excellent Stage 1 implementation and substantial progress on Stage 2. The resolution of the duplicate model definitions removes a critical blocker and positions the project for successful continuation. The HTML5 Canvas integration and Component Palette functionality are now complete and fully functional, providing a solid foundation for schematic design.

Recent improvements have significantly enhanced the user experience:
- **Professional Visual Appearance**: Components now feature gradients, shadows, and depth effects that make them look modern and professional
- **Enhanced Text Rendering**: Text scaling issues have been resolved with proper font size management and text shadows for better visibility across all zoom levels
- **Improved Component Placement**: Components are now properly positioned with overlap detection, grid snapping, and automatic position adjustment to prevent cramming
- **Advanced Pin Rendering**: Pins now feature gradients, highlights, and labels when zoomed in, providing better visual feedback
- **Robust Configuration**: All project configuration issues have been resolved, including security improvements, window sizing, and proper error handling

Users can now drag and drop components from the palette onto the canvas with full zoom, pan, and selection capabilities, while enjoying a much more professional and polished visual experience. The immediate focus should be on implementing the Properties Panel to achieve a minimally viable product for schematic design. With proper focus on the prioritized action items, the project can progress through the remaining stages and deliver a professional intercom system design tool.

The project demonstrates excellent architectural decisions and modern development practices, providing a strong foundation for continued development. The main challenge will be implementing the wiring system and advanced component interaction features while maintaining performance and usability.
