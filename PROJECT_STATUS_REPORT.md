## Conclusion
SignalPath has a solid architectural foundation with excellent Stage 1 implementation and significant progress on Stage 2. The resolution of the duplicate model definitions removes a critical blocker and positions the project for successful continuation. The HTML5 Canvas integration and Component Palette functionality are now complete and fully functional, providing a solid foundation for schematic design. Users can now drag and drop components from the palette onto the canvas, with full zoom, pan, and selection capabilities. The immediate focus should be on implementing the Properties Panel to achieve a minimally viable product for schematic design. With proper focus on the prioritized action items, the project can progress through the remaining stages and deliver a professional intercom system design tool.
The project demonstrates good architectural decisions and modern development practices, providing a strong foundation for continued development. The main challenge will be implementing the wiring system and advanced component interaction features while maintaining performance and usability.
