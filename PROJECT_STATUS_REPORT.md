## Conclusion
SignalPath has a solid architectural foundation with excellent Stage 1 implementation. The resolution of the duplicate model definitions removes a critical blocker and positions the project for successful continuation. The immediate focus should be on implementing the HTML5 Canvas integration and completing the Component Palette functionality to achieve a minimally viable product for schematic design. With proper focus on the prioritized action items, the project can progress through the remaining stages and deliver a professional intercom system design tool.
The project demonstrates good architectural decisions and modern development practices, providing a strong foundation for continued development. The main challenge will be implementing the complex interaction and wiring features while maintaining performance and usability.
