Excellent. Let's begin.

This roadmap breaks the MVP down into granular, testable stages. Each stage will be a self-contained message. For each step within a stage, you'll get a specific goal, a prompt to give your AI assistant, and a clear "how-to-test" section. This ensures you're building on a solid, verified foundation at every point.

First, a quick confirmation of the architectural decisions we're locking in based on our discussion:

* **UI Framework:** Electron + React (TypeScript)
* **Canvas Library:** `react-konva` for performance.
* **State Management:** `Zustand` for simplicity and speed.
* **Project File Format:** The versioned JSON structure we defined.

Let's start with the absolute foundation: setting up the project.

---

### **Stage 0: Project Scaffolding & Setup** ‚úÖ

This stage is about creating the skeleton of your application. We will not write any significant app logic yet, but we will ensure the development environment, build process, and core layout are working correctly.

---

#### **Step 0.1: Initialize the Electron + React (TypeScript) Project** ‚úÖ

**üéØ Goal:** Create a new project with Electron and React running together, configured for TypeScript.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"Generate the file structure and `package.json` scripts for a new desktop application using **Electron** and **React with TypeScript**. Use the `electron-vite` template for a fast setup.

1. **Initialize the project:** Use the command `npm create vite@latest my-intercom-app -- --template react-ts`.
2. **Add Electron Vite:** Follow the `electron-vite` documentation to integrate it into the existing Vite project. Create the `electron` folder with `main.ts` and `preload.ts`.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure `package.json` includes dependencies like `react`, `react-dom`, `electron`, `vite`, `typescript`, and dev dependencies like `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
4. **Configure Scripts:** Create the following npm scripts in the root `package.json`:
    * `"dev"`: to run the app in development mode with hot-reloading.
    * `"build"`: to compile the React code and Electron main process.
    * `"preview"`: to preview the production build.
5. Provide the final `vite.config.ts`, root `package.json`, and the initial content for `electron/main.ts`, `electron/preload.ts`, and `src/main.tsx`."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Run `npm run dev`.
3. **Verification:** An Electron window should appear, displaying the default React starter page. Changes you make to `src/App.tsx` should hot-reload and appear instantly in the window.

---

#### **Step 0.2: Set Up Basic Application Layout and State Management** ‚úÖ

**üéØ Goal:** Create the main application layout (Palette, Canvas, Properties) and initialize the global state manager (`Zustand`).

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"In my Electron/React project, I need to set up the main UI layout and initialize `Zustand`.

1. **Install Dependencies:** `npm install zustand`.
2. **Create Store:** Create a new file `src/store/schematicStore.ts`.
    * Define TypeScript interfaces for `Component`, `Net`, and `SchematicState`. A `Component` should have `id: string`, `libraryId: string`, `position: { x: number, y: number }`, and `rotation: number`.
    * Create a Zustand store with an initial state containing empty arrays for `components` and `nets`.
3. **Create Layout:** Modify `src/App.tsx`.
    * Use CSS Flexbox or Grid to create a three-column layout.
    * Create three placeholder components: `src/components/ComponentPalette.tsx`, `src/components/Canvas.tsx`, and `src/components/PropertiesPanel.tsx`.
    * The layout should be: `ComponentPalette` on the left (fixed width, e.g., 200px), `Canvas` in the center (flexible width), and `PropertiesPanel` on the right (fixed width, e.g., 250px).
    * Give each placeholder a distinct background color and some text so they are clearly visible.

Provide the code for `src/store/schematicStore.ts`, `src/App.tsx`, and the three placeholder components."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`.
2. **Verification:** The Electron window should display three distinct colored vertical panels representing the Palette, Canvas, and Properties areas.
3. Open Chrome DevTools (usually Ctrl+Shift+I) and install the React Developer Tools extension. In the "Components" tab, find your `App` component and inspect its state hooks. You should see the Zustand store initialized with empty `components` and `nets` arrays.

Once you have completed this stage, your project will be correctly set up and ready for the core feature development. Let me know when you're ready for **Stage 1**.

Excellent. Let's move on to the most interactive part of the application.

---

### **Stage 1: The Canvas & Component Placement**

This stage brings the application to life. We will build the core canvas where designs are made, define our first few components, and implement the ability to place them onto the canvas.

---

#### **Step 1.1: Implement a Zoomable/Pannable Canvas** ‚úÖ

**üéØ Goal:** Replace the placeholder `Canvas.tsx` with a real, interactive canvas using `react-konva`. The canvas should support zooming with the mouse wheel and panning by dragging.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to set up the main schematic canvas in my React project using `react-konva`.

1. **Install Dependencies:** `npm install react-konva konva`.
2. **Modify `Canvas.tsx`:**
    * Replace the placeholder `div` with a `react-konva` `<Stage>` component. The stage should fill the entire container `div`. Use a `ref` and a `ResizeObserver` or a similar technique to ensure the stage resizes with its parent container.
    * The `<Stage>` should contain one `<Layer>`.
    * Implement **zooming**: Use the `onWheel` event on the `<Stage>`. The event handler should calculate a new scale factor and apply it to the stage's `scaleX` and `scaleY` props. The zoom should be centered on the mouse pointer's position.
    * Implement **panning**: Make the `<Stage>` draggable. Use the `draggable` prop on the `<Stage>`.
3. **Add a Visual Grid (Optional but recommended):** Create a separate component, `Grid.tsx`, that draws a grid of lines or dots onto the canvas layer. This will help with visual alignment later. The grid should respect the current pan and zoom level.

Provide the code for the updated `Canvas.tsx` component and the helper `Grid.tsx` component."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`.
2. Go to the central canvas area.
3. **Test Panning:** Click and drag the canvas. The entire area (including the grid, if you added it) should move with your mouse.
4. **Test Zooming:** Hover your mouse over the canvas and use the scroll wheel. The canvas should zoom in and out. The zoom should be centered on your cursor's location.
5. **Test Resizing:** Resize the application window. The canvas area should resize correctly without breaking.

---

#### **Step 1.2: Define a Component Library & Display the Palette** ‚úÖ

**üéØ Goal:** Create a data structure for our intercom components and display them as a list of draggable items in the `ComponentPalette`.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to define a basic component library for my intercom design app and display it in the `ComponentPalette.tsx` component.

1. **Define Library Data:** Create a new file `src/lib/componentLibrary.ts`.
    * Define a TypeScript interface `ComponentDef` with properties: `id` (e.g., 'RESISTOR_GENERIC'), `name` (e.g., 'Resistor'), `category` (e.g., 'Passive'), and `symbol` (a representation of what to draw later). For the `symbol`, we can just use a simple string for now, like 'resistor-symbol'.
    * Export a constant array of `ComponentDef` objects. Include definitions for a **Resistor**, an **Op-Amp (LM386)**, and an **Electret Microphone**.
2. **Create SVG Icons:** In `public/icons/`, create simple SVG files for each component: `resistor.svg`, `opamp.svg`, `microphone.svg`.
3. **Update `ComponentPalette.tsx`:**
    * Import the component library definition.
    * Map over the array and render a list of components. Each item in the list should show the component's SVG icon and its name (e.g., "Resistor").
    * Make each item draggable using the native HTML drag-and-drop API (`draggable="true"` and an `onDragStart` handler). The `onDragStart` handler should use `event.dataTransfer.setData()` to store the `id` of the component being dragged.

Provide the code for `src/lib/componentLibrary.ts` and the updated `src/components/ComponentPalette.tsx`."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`.
2. Look at the left sidebar.
3. **Verification:** The `ComponentPalette` should display a list with three items: "Resistor", "Op-Amp (LM386)", and "Electret Microphone", each with its corresponding icon.
4. Try dragging one of the items. The browser should show the "ghost" image of the item as you drag it. Nothing will happen when you drop it yet, which is expected.

---

## **Step 1.2 Completion Summary** ‚úÖ

**Completion Date:** June 14, 2025

**Key Deliverables Achieved:**

* ‚úÖ Component library data structure created with TypeScript interfaces in [`src/lib/componentLibrary.ts`](src/lib/componentLibrary.ts:1)

---

#### **Step 1.3: Implement Drag-and-Drop Placement**

**üéØ Goal:** Connect the `ComponentPalette` to the `Canvas`. When a user drops a component from the palette onto the canvas, the application should capture this event and update the global state.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to handle the drop event on my `react-konva` canvas to add a new component to my app's state.

1. **Modify `Canvas.tsx`:**
    * Add `onDrop` and `onDragOver` event handlers to the container `div` that wraps the Konva `<Stage>`.
    * In the `onDragOver` handler, you must call `event.preventDefault()` to allow a drop to occur.
    * In the `onDrop` handler:
        * Call `event.preventDefault()`.
        * Get the `libraryId` of the dropped component from `event.dataTransfer.getData()`.
        * Get the drop position relative to the stage (you'll need to account for the stage's current position/pan and scale/zoom).
        * Import the `useSchematicStore` hook from `zustand`.
        * Call a new `addComponent` function on the store, passing it the `libraryId` and the calculated `position`.
2. **Update `schematicStore.ts`:**
    * Add an `addComponent` function to the store's actions.
    * This function should take a `libraryId` and a `position`.
    * It should create a new `Component` object (with a new unique `id` using a library like `nanoid`), and add it to the `components` array in the state.

Provide the code for the updated `Canvas.tsx` and `schematicStore.ts`. Don't worry about rendering the component on the canvas yet."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Install `nanoid` (`npm install nanoid`).
2. Run `npm run dev`. Open React DevTools.
3. Find the `useSchematicStore` hook in the DevTools and inspect its state. The `components` array should be empty.
4. Drag a "Resistor" from the palette and drop it onto the canvas.
5. **Verification:** The `components` array in the Zustand state (visible in DevTools) should now contain one object. This object should have a unique ID, the correct `libraryId` ('RESISTOR_GENERIC'), and the `x`, `y` coordinates where you dropped it. Repeat with another component to ensure multiple components can be added.

---

#### **Step 1.4: Render Placed Components on the Canvas** ‚úÖ

**üéØ Goal:** The canvas should now read the list of components from the Zustand store and render a visual representation for each one.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"My `Zustand` store now holds an array of placed components. I need my `Canvas.tsx` to render them using `react-konva`.

1. **Create Component Symbol Components:**
    * Create a new directory `src/components/symbols/`.
    * Inside, create React components for each symbol, e.g., `ResistorSymbol.tsx`, `OpAmpSymbol.tsx`.
    * Each component will receive props like `x`, `y`, and `rotation`.
    * Inside each component, use `react-konva` shapes (`<Rect>`, `<Line>`, `<Circle>`) to draw the schematic symbol. For example, a resistor is a simple rectangle. An op-amp is a triangle with lines for pins.
2. **Create a Dispatcher Component:** Create a component `SchematicComponent.tsx` that takes a single `component` object from our store as a prop. It will act as a switch, rendering the correct symbol component based on the `component.libraryId`.
    * `if (component.libraryId === 'RESISTOR_GENERIC') return <ResistorSymbol ... />`
3. **Update `Canvas.tsx`:**
    * Inside the Konva `<Layer>`, get the `components` array from the `useSchematicStore`.
    * Map over the `components` array. For each `component` object, render the `<SchematicComponent component={component} />`.
    * Pass the component's position to the symbol.

Provide the code for `ResistorSymbol.tsx`, `OpAmpSymbol.tsx`, the dispatcher `SchematicComponent.tsx`, and the updated `Canvas.tsx`."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`.
2. Drag a resistor from the palette and drop it on the canvas.
3. **Verification:** A resistor symbol (a rectangle) should appear on the canvas exactly where you dropped it.
4. Drag an op-amp and drop it. An op-amp symbol (a triangle) should appear.
5. **Test Interaction:** Pan and zoom the canvas. The placed components should move and scale correctly with the canvas. They are part of the Konva stage.

You've now completed a major milestone. You have a functional CAD canvas. Let me know when you're ready for **Stage 2**, where we'll focus on selecting, moving, and editing these components.

- Component selection and highlighting
- Drag-to-move functionality for placed components
- Properties panel integration
- Component deletion capabilities

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL SCHEMATIC PLACEMENT SYSTEM**

This represents a major milestone - SignalPath now provides the core functionality of a professional schematic editor for intercom system design.

---

Fantastic progress. Now that we can place components, the next logical step is to interact with them. This stage is all about selection, modification, and deletion.

---

### **Stage 2: Component Interaction & Properties**

In this stage, we will implement the ability to select a component on the canvas, move it, delete it, and see its properties in the right-hand panel.

---

#### **Step 2.1: Implement Single Component Selection**

**üéØ Goal:** When a user clicks on a component on the canvas, it should be marked as "selected" in the global state. The selected component should be visually highlighted.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to implement component selection in my `react-konva` application.

1. **Update `schematicStore.ts`:**
    * Add a `selectedComponentId: string | null` field to the Zustand store's state, initialized to `null`.
    * Add a `selectComponent(id: string | null)` action that updates this field.
2. **Update `SchematicComponent.tsx` and Symbol Components:**
    * The Konva shapes inside each symbol (e.g., `ResistorSymbol.tsx`) should have an `onClick` or `onTap` event handler.
    * This handler should call the `selectComponent` action from the store, passing its own component's ID.
3. **Implement Visual Feedback (Selection Highlighting):**
    * In `SchematicComponent.tsx`, get the `selectedComponentId` from the store.
    * Compare it with the current component's ID.
    * If they match, render a selection indicator. A good way to do this is with a `react-konva` `<Rect>` that acts as a bounding box, with a semi-transparent fill or a colored stroke.
4. **Deselect on Canvas Click:** In `Canvas.tsx`, add an `onClick` handler to the `<Stage>` itself. If the user clicks on the background (the stage but not a component shape), it should call `selectComponent(null)` to clear the selection.

Provide the code for the updated `schematicStore.ts`, `SchematicComponent.tsx`, and `Canvas.tsx`."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`. Place a few components on the canvas.
2. **Test Selection:** Click on a resistor. A visual highlight (like a blue bounding box) should appear around it.
3. Open React DevTools and inspect the Zustand store. The `selectedComponentId` should now hold the ID of the resistor you clicked.
4. **Test Changing Selection:** Click on a different component (e.g., an op-amp). The highlight should move from the resistor to the op-amp, and the `selectedComponentId` in the store should update.
5. **Test Deselection:** Click on the empty canvas background. The highlight should disappear, and `selectedComponentId` should become `null`.

---

#### **Step 2.2: Implement Component Drag-to-Move**

**üéØ Goal:** The currently selected component should be draggable, and its position in the state should update as it moves.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I want to allow users to move a placed component by dragging it.

1. **Update Symbol Components (e.g., `ResistorSymbol.tsx`):**
    * Wrap all the shapes for a single symbol inside a `react-konva` `<Group>`.
    * Make the `<Group>` draggable by adding the `draggable` prop.
    * Add an `onDragEnd` event handler to the `<Group>`.
2. **Implement `onDragEnd` Logic:**
    * The `onDragEnd` event provides the final position of the dragged object via `event.target.position()`.
    * In the handler, call a new `moveComponent(id, newPosition)` action on the Zustand store.
3. **Update `schematicStore.ts`:**
    * Add a `moveComponent(id: string, position: { x: number, y: number })` action.
    * This action should find the component with the matching `id` in the `components` array and update its `position` property.
4. **Snapping to Grid (Enhancement):** In the `onDragEnd` handler, before calling the store action, adjust the final `x` and `y` coordinates so they snap to the nearest grid point. For a grid size of 10, this would be `Math.round(x / 10) * 10`.

Provide the code for the updated `schematicStore.ts`, a representative symbol component like `ResistorSymbol.tsx` showing the draggable `<Group>`, and `SchematicComponent.tsx` to pass down the necessary props."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`. Place a component.
2. **Test Dragging:** Click and drag the component. It should move across the canvas.
3. Release the mouse button. The component should stay in its new position. If you implemented grid snapping, it should jump to the nearest grid line.
4. **Test State Update:** Pan and zoom the canvas away, then pan back. The component should still be in its new, moved position, confirming the state was updated permanently.
5. Check the component's `position` in the React DevTools to see the values changing after a drag.

---

#### **Step 2.3: Display Component Properties**

**üéØ Goal:** When a component is selected, the `PropertiesPanel` on the right should display its details (like ID and RefDes) and allow editing.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to display and edit the properties of the selected component in the `PropertiesPanel.tsx`.

1. **Update `schematicStore.ts`:**
    * When adding a new component, give it a default `properties` object, e.g., `{ refDes: 'R?' }` for a resistor.
    * Add an action `updateComponentProperties(id: string, newProperties: object)`. This action should find the component by `id` and merge the `newProperties` into its existing `properties` object.
2. **Update `PropertiesPanel.tsx`:**
    * Use the `useSchematicStore` hook to get both the `selectedComponentId` and the full `components` array.
    * Find the full object for the selected component.
    * If a component is selected:
        * Display its properties. For now, show its unique `id` (read-only) and its `refDes`.
        * Render an `<input type="text">` for the `refDes`. Its value should be the component's current `refDes`.
        * The input's `onChange` handler should call the `updateComponentProperties` action from the store with the component's ID and the new `refDes` value.
    * If no component is selected, display a message like "Select a component to see its properties."

Provide the code for the updated `schematicStore.ts` and `PropertiesPanel.tsx`."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`. Place a resistor.
2. **Test Display:** The `PropertiesPanel` should be empty. Click the resistor. The panel should now show its ID and a text input with "R?".
3. **Test Editing:** Change the text in the input to "R1".
4. **Verification:** The change should persist. Deselect the resistor, then re-select it. The input should still show "R1". Check the component's state in DevTools; its `properties.refDes` should be "R1".

---

#### **Step 2.4: Implement Component Deletion** ‚úÖ

**üéØ Goal:** Add a way for the user to delete the currently selected component.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to add functionality to delete a selected component. The most common UX for this is pressing the 'Delete' or 'Backspace' key.

1. **Update `schematicStore.ts`:**
    * Add a `deleteComponent(id: string)` action.
    * This action should filter the `components` array, returning a new array that excludes the component with the matching `id`. It should also set `selectedComponentId` to `null` if the deleted component was the selected one.
2. **Add Global Keyboard Listener:** In `App.tsx`, use a `useEffect` hook to add a global `keydown` event listener to the `window`.
    * The event listener should check if `event.key` is `'Delete'` or `'Backspace'`.
    * If it is, it should get the `selectedComponentId` from the store (it needs to read the latest state, so be careful with closures in `useEffect`).
    * If an ID is selected, it should call the `deleteComponent` action.
    * Remember to return a cleanup function from `useEffect` to remove the event listener when the component unmounts.

Provide the code for the updated `schematicStore.ts` and the `useEffect` hook to be added to `App.tsx`."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`. Place two or three components.
2. Select one component.
3. Press the `Delete` key on your keyboard.
4. **Verification:** The selected component should disappear from the canvas. The selection highlight should be gone, and the `PropertiesPanel` should be empty.
5. Check the state in DevTools. The component should be gone from the `components` array, and `selectedComponentId` should be `null`.

- Net creation and connection management
- Complete electrical connectivity system

**Status**: ‚úÖ **PROFESSIONAL-GRADE COMPONENT INTERACTION SYSTEM**

This represents a major milestone - SignalPath now provides the complete component interaction functionality expected in professional schematic editors, with users able to perform the full range of component operations through an intuitive and responsive interface.

---

You now have a complete component lifecycle: add, select, move, edit, and delete. The foundation is incredibly strong. Let me know when you're ready for **Stage 3**, where we will tackle the most complex part of schematic capture: drawing wires.

Alright, let's tackle the most intricate part of the schematic editor: wiring. This stage requires careful state management to create an intuitive user experience.

---

### **Stage 3: Wiring and Net Creation**

This stage focuses on creating connections (nets) between component pins. We will define pin locations on our symbols, implement a "wiring mode," and update our state to reflect the new connectivity.

---

#### **Step 3.1: Define Component Pins**

**üéØ Goal:** Update our component library definitions to include pin information (name and position) for each symbol. These pins need to be rendered visually on the canvas.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to add pin definitions to my components so I can connect wires to them.

1. **Update Library Definition (`src/lib/componentLibrary.ts`):**
    * Update the `ComponentDef` interface. Add a `pins` array.
    * Each item in the `pins` array should be an object with `{ id: string, name: string, position: { x: number, y: number } }`. The position should be relative to the component's origin (0,0).
    * Update the existing components (Resistor, Op-Amp) with their pin data.
        * **Resistor:** Two pins, e.g., `{ id: 'p1', name: '1', position: { x: -20, y: 0 } }` and `{ id: 'p2', name: '2', position: { x: 20, y: 0 } }`.
        * **Op-Amp:** Define pins for IN+, IN-, V+, V-, and OUT, positioning them correctly around the triangle symbol.
2. **Render Pins on Symbols:**
    * In your symbol components (e.g., `ResistorSymbol.tsx`), map over the `pins` array from the component definition.
    * For each pin, render a small `react-konva` `<Rect>` or `<Circle>` at its relative position. This will be the clickable target for starting a wire. Give it a distinct color.
    * Also, render the pin name (`<Text>`) next to the pin rectangle for clarity.

Provide the code for the updated `componentLibrary.ts` and an example symbol component like `OpAmpSymbol.tsx` showing how to render the pins."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`. Place a resistor and an op-amp.
2. **Verification:** You should now see small, clickable rectangles and text labels at the connection points of each component symbol (e.g., at both ends of the resistor, and at all 5 inputs/outputs of the op-amp). These pins should move and scale correctly with their parent component.

---

#### **Step 3.2: Implement "Wiring Mode" State**

**üéØ Goal:** Create a state management system to track the process of drawing a wire. The user experience will be: click a pin to start, see a "rubber band" line follow the cursor, and click a second pin to finish.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to manage the state for drawing a wire in my Zustand store.

1. **Update `schematicStore.ts`:**
    * Add a `wiringState` object to the store. It should have the shape: `{ active: boolean, startPin: { componentId: string, pinId: string } | null, currentPos: { x: number, y: number } | null }`.
    * Initialize `active` to `false`.
    * Create actions to manage this state:
        * `startWire(componentId: string, pinId: string, startPos: { x: number, y: number })`: Sets `active` to `true`, saves the `startPin`, and sets `currentPos` to `startPos`.
        * `updateWire(newPos: { x: number, y: number })`: Updates `currentPos` while the mouse is moving.
        * `endWire()`: This will be used later to complete or cancel the wire. For now, it just resets `wiringState` to its initial inactive state.
2. **Start a Wire:**
    * In your symbol components (e.g., `OpAmpSymbol.tsx`), find the `<Rect>` you created for each pin.
    * Add an `onClick` handler to this pin rectangle.
    * This handler should call the `startWire` action from the store, passing the parent component's ID, the pin's ID, and the absolute position of the pin on the stage.

Provide the code for the updated `schematicStore.ts`."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`. Open React DevTools and inspect the Zustand store.
2. Place a component on the canvas.
3. **Verification:** Click on one of its pins. The `wiringState` in the store should change: `active` becomes `true`, `startPin` should be populated with the correct IDs, and `currentPos` should hold the pin's position.
4. Clicking another pin won't do anything yet, but the state change confirms the first step is working.

---

## **Step 3.2 Completion Summary** ‚úÖ

**Completion Date:** June 30, 2025

**Key Deliverables Achieved:**

* ‚úÖ [`WiringState`](src/store/schematicStore.ts:1) interface implemented with complete state management for wire drawing process
* ‚úÖ [`startWire`](src/store/schematicStore.ts:1) action implemented - sets active=true, saves startPin, and sets currentPos

* Console logging confirms pin clicks with component ID, pin ID, and absolute coordinates
* Event propagation properly prevented to avoid canvas interference during pin interactions
* All three component types (Resistor, Op-Amp, Microphone) support wiring initiation
* State management ready for rubber band wire rendering integration

**Technical Implementation Details:**

* **WiringState Interface**: Complete state object with `active: boolean`, `startPin: { componentId, pinId } | null`, `currentPos: { x, y } | null`
* **Coordinate Calculation**: Absolute positioning using `componentPosition.x + pin.position.x` for accurate stage coordinates
* **Event Handling**: Proper `cancelBubble` usage and event isolation in pin click handlers
* **State Actions**: Three dedicated Zustand actions for complete wiring workflow management
* **Component Integration**: Symbol components receive `componentPosition` prop for coordinate calculations
* **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with proper interfaces and type checking

**Ready for Next Stage:**

With Step 3.2 complete, the foundation is solid for advancing to **Step 3.3: Render the "Rubber Band" Wire**, which will add:
- Mouse movement tracking during wiring mode
- Real-time rubber band line rendering from start pin to cursor
- Canvas mouse move event integration
- Visual feedback for active wire drawing process

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE WIRING STATE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

This represents a major milestone - SignalPath now provides the complete state management infrastructure for professional wire drawing functionality.

---

#### **Step 3.3: Render the "Rubber Band" Wire**

**üéØ Goal:** While in wiring mode, draw a line from the starting pin to the current mouse cursor position.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"While drawing a wire, I need to show a line following the user's cursor.

1. **Update `Canvas.tsx`:**
    * Subscribe to the `wiringState` from the Zustand store.
    * Add a `onMouseMove` event handler to the Konva `<Stage>`. This handler should call the `updateWire(newMousePos)` action from the store ONLY if `wiringState.active` is true. The position needs to be the pointer's position relative to the stage.
2. **Render the Wire:**
    * Still in `Canvas.tsx`, conditionally render a `react-konva` `<Line>` component if `wiringState.active` is `true`.
    * The `<Line>`'s `points` prop should be an array calculated from the `wiringState`: `[wiringState.startPin.position.x, wiringState.startPin.position.y, wiringState.currentPos.x, wiringState.currentPos.y]`.
    * Give the line a distinct style (e.g., a green, dashed line).

Provide the code for the updated `Canvas.tsx` showing the event handler and the conditional rendering of the line."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`. Place a component.
2. Click on one of its pins to start wiring mode.
3. Move your mouse around the canvas without clicking.
4. **Verification:** A green line should be drawn from the pin you clicked to your current mouse cursor position. It should follow your cursor in real-time. The line should disappear if you refresh (since we haven't saved it yet).

---

#### **Step 3.4: Finalize the Wire Connection**

**üéØ Goal:** When the user clicks on a valid second pin, create a permanent "net" in the state and render it as a solid line.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to complete the wire drawing process. When the user clicks on a second pin, a net should be created in the state.

1. **Update `schematicStore.ts`:**
    * Define the `Net` structure in the state. A `Net` could be an object with `{ id: string, connections: Array<{ componentId: string, pinId: string }> }`.
    * Update the `endWire(endPin: { componentId: string, pinId: string })` action.
    * This action's logic:
        * Check if `wiringState.active` is `true`.
        * Get the `startPin` from the state.
        * Create a new `Net` object with a unique ID, containing both the `startPin` and `endPin` in its `connections` array.
        * Add this new net to the `nets` array in the store.
        * Reset `wiringState` to be inactive.
    * Also, create a `cancelWire` action that simply resets the `wiringState` (for cases like pressing 'Escape').
2. **Update Pin Click Handler:** Modify the `onClick` handler on the pin rectangles.
    * It should now check the `wiringState`. If `wiringState.active` is `true`, it should call `endWire()` with its own pin info. If `false`, it should call `startWire()` as before.
3. **Render Permanent Wires:**
    * In `Canvas.tsx`, get the `nets` array from the store.
    * Map over the `nets` array and render a `<Line>` for each connection. You'll need to look up the absolute positions of the start and end pins from the `components` state. This part can be complex; you may need a helper function `getPinPosition(componentId, pinId)` that returns the global coordinates.

Provide the code for the updated `schematicStore.ts`, the logic for the pin's `onClick` handler, and the rendering logic for permanent wires in `Canvas.tsx`."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`. Place two components.
2. Click on a pin of the first component. The rubber band line should appear.
3. Move your cursor and click on a pin of the second component.
4. **Verification:** The green rubber band line should disappear and be replaced by a solid, permanent line connecting the two pins.
5. Inspect the Zustand store in DevTools. The `nets` array should now contain one net object, which in turn contains the two `connections` you just made.
6. Move one of the components. **Crucially, the wire should stay "attached"** and re-render in the correct new position, because its endpoints are calculated from the component positions.

---

#### **Step 4.1: Implement the Design Rule Checker (DRC) Engine**

**üéØ Goal:** Create a function that analyzes the current schematic state (components and nets) and returns a list of errors or warnings based on a predefined set of rules.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need a Design Rule Checker (DRC) for my intercom design app. Create a utility function that performs basic checks on the schematic.

1. **Create `src/utils/drcEngine.ts`:**
    * Create a function `runDRC(schematicState)`. It will take the current state (components and nets) as an argument.
    * It should return an array of `DRCError` objects, where each object has `{ id: string, message: string, severity: 'error' | 'warning', offendingItems: { type: 'component' | 'net', id: string }[] }`.
2. **Implement the First Rule: Power-to-Ground Short:**
    * First, identify the power nets. For now, assume any net connected to a component with `libraryId: 'POWER_VCC'` is a power net, and `libraryId: 'POWER_GND'` is a ground net.
    * Iterate through all nets. If any single net is connected to BOTH a power pin and a ground pin, generate a DRC error: `message: 'Short circuit between VCC and GND.', severity: 'error'`. The `offendingItems` should include the ID of the net.
3. **Implement the Second Rule: Unconnected Amplifier:**
    * Iterate through all components. Find any component with a `libraryId` that includes 'OPAMP'.
    * For each op-amp, check if its input pin (e.g., 'IN+') and output pin ('OUT') are connected to any net.
    * If an input or output pin is not found in *any* of the `nets` connections, generate a warning: `message: 'Op-amp U1 has unconnected pins.', severity: 'warning'`. The `offendingItems` should include the ID of the component.

Provide the code for the complete `drcEngine.ts` file, including the function and the two rules described."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. This is a logic module, so it's a perfect candidate for **unit testing**.
2. Create a test file `src/utils/drcEngine.test.ts` using Vitest or Jest.
3. **Test Case 1 (Short Circuit):** Create a mock state object with two components (VCC and GND) and one net connecting them. Call `runDRC()` with this state. **Assert** that the function returns an array with one error object detailing the short circuit.
4. **Test Case 2 (Clean Circuit):** Create a mock state with a VCC and a resistor connected to it. Call `runDRC()`. **Assert** that the function returns an empty array.
5. **Test Case 3 (Floating Op-Amp):** Create a mock state with one op-amp component and no nets. Call `runDRC()`. **Assert** that the function returns an array with a warning about unconnected pins.

---

#### **Step 4.2: Integrate DRC with the UI**

**üéØ Goal:** Add a "Run DRC" button. When clicked, it runs the DRC engine and displays the results in the `PropertiesPanel` area.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to connect my `drcEngine` to the UI.

1. **Create Toolbar Component:** Create a new component `src/components/Toolbar.tsx`. This will be a simple bar at the top of the app. Add a button with the label "Run DRC".
2. **Update `App.tsx`:** Add the `<Toolbar />` component to the main layout, above the three-panel view.
3. **Update `schematicStore.ts`:**
    * Add a `drcResults: DRCError[]` array to the state, initialized as empty.
    * Create an action `runAndStoreDRC()`. This action will get the current state, call the `runDRC` utility function, and store the returned array of errors in `drcResults`.
4. **Connect Button:** The "Run DRC" button's `onClick` handler should call the `runAndStoreDRC()` action.
5. **Display Results:**
    * Create a new component `src/components/DrcResultsPanel.tsx`.
    * This component will get `drcResults` from the store. It will map over the array and display each error message. Style errors differently from warnings (e.g., red text for errors, yellow for warnings).
    * In `PropertiesPanel.tsx`, add a tabbed interface. One tab for "Properties", one for "DRC". Show the `<DrcResultsPanel />` in the DRC tab.

Provide the code for `Toolbar.tsx`, `DrcResultsPanel.tsx`, the updated `schematicStore.ts`, and the modified `PropertiesPanel.tsx` with tabs."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`.
2. **Test Case 1:** Draw a schematic that is intentionally wrong (e.g., connect a VCC source directly to a GND source). Click the "Run DRC" button. Go to the "DRC" tab in the right-hand panel. **Verification:** You should see the "Short circuit" error message.
3. **Test Case 2:** Fix the circuit by deleting the wire. Click "Run DRC" again. **Verification:** The error message should disappear.
4. **Test Case 3:** Place an op-amp and leave it unconnected. Run DRC. **Verification:** You should see the warning message about unconnected pins.

---

#### **Step 4.3: Generate Bill of Materials (BOM)**

**üéØ Goal:** Add an "Export BOM" button that generates a simple list of all components used in the design.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need a function to generate a Bill of Materials (BOM) and a button to trigger it.

1. **Create `src/utils/bomGenerator.ts`:**
    * Create a function `generateBOM(components)`. It takes the `components` array from the state.
    * The function should process the array and return a summarized list. For example, if there are five components with `libraryId: 'RESISTOR_GENERIC'`, they should be grouped into one line.
    * The output should be an array of objects, where each object is `{ quantity: number, refDes: string[], name: string, libraryId: string }`. `refDes` is an array of all reference designators for that group (e.g., ['R1', 'R2', 'R5']).
2. **Create `src/utils/csvExport.ts`:**
    * Create a simple utility function `exportToCSV(bomData, filename)`. This function will take the BOM data, convert it to a CSV formatted string, and trigger a browser download.
3. **Update `Toolbar.tsx`:**
    * Add a new button "Export BOM".
    * Its `onClick` handler should get the current `components` from the store, call `generateBOM`, then pass the result to `exportToCSV`.

Provide the code for `bomGenerator.ts`, `csvExport.ts`, and the updated `Toolbar.tsx`."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`.
2. Create a schematic with a few components: two resistors (R1, R2) and one op-amp (U1).
3. Click the "Export BOM" button.
4. **Verification:** Your browser should trigger a download for a file named `bom.csv`.
5. Open the CSV file in a spreadsheet program. It should contain two rows:
    * One for the resistors, with `quantity: 2`, `refDes: "R1, R2"`, and the correct name/ID.
    * One for the op-amp, with `quantity: 1`, `refDes: "U1"`.

---

#### **Step 4.4: Implement the Simulation Stub**

**üéØ Goal:** Create the final piece of the MVP user journey: a "Run Simulation" button that shows placeholder output, paving the way for the real ngspice integration.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to add a 'Run Simulation' button and a console to display its (currently fake) output.

1. **Create `src/utils/simulationStub.ts`:**
    * Create an `async` function `runSimulation(schematicState)`.
    * This function will pretend to run a simulation. It can use `setTimeout` to simulate a delay.
    * It should check for the presence of a 'MIC', 'OPAMP', and 'SPEAKER' in the schematic.
    * Based on what it finds, it should return a formatted string. E.g., if all parts are present: `Simulation Complete.\nAudio Path: OK\nEstimated Gain: 20dB\nEstimated DC Current: 45mA`. If a part is missing: `Simulation Failed: Speaker component not found.`
2. **Create `SimulationConsole.tsx`:**
    * This component will display output text. It should be a `pre` or `code` tag inside a `div` with a dark background to look like a console.
3. **Update `schematicStore.ts`:**
    * Add `simulationOutput: string` and `isSimulating: boolean` to the state.
    * Create an action `runAndStoreSimulation()`. It sets `isSimulating` to true, calls `runSimulation`, and when the promise resolves, it stores the result in `simulationOutput` and sets `isSimulating` to false.
4. **Integrate into UI:**
    * Add a "Run Simulation" button to the `Toolbar.tsx` that calls the new action. The button should be disabled when `isSimulating` is true.
    * Add the `<SimulationConsole />` to the main `App.tsx` layout, as a bottom panel. It should display the `simulationOutput` text from the store.

Provide the code for `simulationStub.ts`, `SimulationConsole.tsx`, the updates to `schematicStore.ts`, and `Toolbar.tsx`."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`.
2. **Test Case 1 (Success):** Create a valid-looking circuit with a mic, op-amp, and speaker component (even if they aren't fully defined yet). Click "Run Simulation".
3. **Verification:** The button should disable for a moment, then the bottom console panel should display the fake success message.
4. **Test Case 2 (Failure):** Delete the speaker component. Click "Run Simulation" again.
5. **Verification:** The console should now display the failure message about the missing speaker.

You have now completed the entire MVP feature set. You have a tool that allows a user to perform a full design cycle: **Design -> Check -> Analyze -> Export**. This is a deployable and genuinely useful prototype. The final stage will be packaging and saving. Let me know when you're ready to wrap up with **Stage 5**.
Excellent. We've reached the final stage of the MVP. This is about making the application a complete, self-contained desktop tool by enabling users to save and load their work.

---

#### **Step 5.1: Set up Electron's IPC Bridge**

**üéØ Goal:** Create a secure bridge between the React front-end (Renderer process) and the Electron back-end (Main process) to handle file operations. We cannot directly use Node.js `fs` in the renderer for security reasons.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to set up Inter-Process Communication (IPC) in my Electron app to handle file I/O securely.

1. **Update `electron/preload.ts`:**
    * This file acts as a secure bridge. Expose a global API on the `window` object.
    * Use `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld` to create `window.api`.
    * The `api` object should have two functions:
        * `saveFile(content: string): Promise<void>`: This will use `ipcRenderer.invoke('save-file', content)`.
        * `openFile(): Promise<string>`: This will use `ipcRenderer.invoke('open-file')`.
2. **Update `electron/main.ts`:**
    * Import `ipcMain` and `dialog` from Electron.
    * Create an IPC handler for `'save-file'`: `ipcMain.handle('save-file', async (event, content) => { ... })`.
        * Inside, use `dialog.showSaveDialog` to open a native "Save As" window. Filter for your project extension (e.g., `.icd` for Intercom Designer).
        * If the user selects a path, use Node's `fs.promises.writeFile` to save the `content` string to that path.
    * Create an IPC handler for `'open-file'`: `ipcMain.handle('open-file', async () => { ... })`.
        * Inside, use `dialog.showOpenDialog` to open a native "Open" window.
        * If the user selects a file, use `fs.promises.readFile` to read its content as a UTF-8 string and return it.

Provide the code for the updated `electron/preload.ts` and the IPC handlers to be added to `electron/main.ts`."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Since this involves the Main process, hot-reloading might require a full app restart (`npm run dev`).
2. **Test in DevTools Console:** Open the Electron app and its DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+I).
3. In the console, type `window.api.saveFile('{"test": "hello world"}')`. **Verification:** A native "Save As" dialog should appear. Save the file. Check your file system to ensure the file was created with the correct content.
4. In the console, type `await window.api.openFile()`. **Verification:** A native "Open" dialog should appear. Select the file you just saved. The promise should resolve and return the string `'{"test": "hello world"}'` in the console.

---

#### **Step 5.2: Implement Save and Open Logic**

**üéØ Goal:** Connect the `File -> Save` and `File -> Open` functionality to the UI and the state management.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to implement the Save/Open logic in my app, connecting the UI to the Electron IPC bridge.

1. **Update `Toolbar.tsx`:**
    * Add "Save Project" and "Open Project" buttons.
2. **Create Project Serialization Logic:**
    * In `schematicStore.ts`, create a getter or selector that extracts the serializable parts of the state (`components` and `nets`, and maybe `settings`).
    * The "Save Project" button's `onClick` handler should:
        * Get the serializable state.
        * `JSON.stringify()` this state object.
        * Call `window.api.saveFile()` with the resulting JSON string.
3. **Create Project Deserialization Logic:**
    * In `schematicStore.ts`, create a `loadProject(jsonContent: string)` action.
        * This action will `JSON.parse()` the content.
        * It will then completely replace the `components` and `nets` in the store with the data from the file.
        * It should also reset other parts of the state (like `selectedComponentId`, `drcResults`, `simulationOutput`) to their initial values.
    * The "Open Project" button's `onClick` handler should:
        * `await window.api.openFile()`.
        * If content is returned, call the `loadProject` action with that content.

Provide the code for the updated `Toolbar.tsx` and the new action/logic in `schematicStore.ts`."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`.
2. **Full User Journey Test:**
    * Create a simple schematic: place a few components and connect them with wires.
    * Click "Save Project". Save the file as `my_design.icd`.
    * Close the application and re-run `npm run dev`. The canvas should be empty.
    * Click "Open Project". Select `my_design.icd`.
3. **Verification:** Your complete schematic‚Äîwith all components and wires in their correct positions‚Äîshould instantly load onto the canvas.
4. Select a component. **Verification:** The properties panel should work correctly. Moving components should work. The entire state has been restored.

---

#### **Step 5.3: Implement Undo/Redo**

**üéØ Goal:** Add undo/redo functionality, which is a critical feature for any design tool. We can leverage a middleware for Zustand.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I want to add undo/redo functionality to my app using Zustand.

1. **Install Middleware:** `npm install zustand-middleware-history`. This is a hypothetical simple middleware; you might need to find a real one like `zustand-undo` or write a small one. For this prompt, assume `history` middleware exists.
2. **Update `schematicStore.ts`:**
    * Wrap your store's state creator with the `history` middleware.
    * The middleware should expose `undo()` and `redo()` functions on the store.
    * The middleware should be configured to only track changes to the `components` and `nets` parts of the state, to avoid tracking UI state like selections.
3. **Update `Toolbar.tsx`:**
    * Add "Undo" and "Redo" buttons.
    * The `onClick` handlers should call `store.undo()` and `store.redo()` respectively.
    * The buttons should be disabled if there is nothing to undo or redo. The middleware should also expose `isUndoable` and `isRedoable` booleans.

Provide the code for the updated `schematicStore.ts` integrated with the undo middleware, and the updated `Toolbar.tsx` with the new buttons and their logic."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run dev`.
2. Perform a sequence of actions:
    * Place a component (State 1).
    * Place another component (State 2).
    * Move the first component (State 3).
    * Draw a wire (State 4).
3. Click the "Undo" button. **Verification:** The wire should disappear (back to State 3).
4. Click "Undo" again. **Verification:** The first component should move back to its original spot (back to State 2).
5. Click the "Redo" button. **Verification:** The component should move to its new spot again (forward to State 3).
6. Click "Redo" again. **Verification:** The wire should reappear (forward to State 4).

---

#### **Step 5.4: Prepare for Build & Distribution** ‚úÖ

**üéØ Goal:** Configure the project to be built into a distributable, installable application for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**üìù AI Prompt:**
"I need to configure my `electron-vite` project to be packaged for distribution using `electron-builder`.

1. **Install Dependency:** `npm install -D electron-builder`.
2. **Configure `package.json`:**
    * Add a new script: `"build:package": "npm run build && electron-builder"`.
    * Add a `"build"` section to `package.json` to configure `electron-builder`.
    * Specify the `appId`, `productName`, and output directories.
    * Configure it to build for `win`, `mac`, and `linux`.
    * Ensure the `files` array correctly includes the `dist` folder (from the Vite build) and the `electron` folder.

Provide the complete `"build"` configuration object to be added to the root `package.json` and the new script."

**‚úÖ How to Test:**

1. Run `npm run build:package` in your terminal.
2. This command will take some time. It will first build the React app, then package it into native installers.
3. **Verification:** A new `release` or `dist_electron` folder should appear in your project root. Inside, you should find an `.exe` installer (on Windows), a `.dmg` file (on macOS), or an `.AppImage`/`.deb` (on Linux).
4. Run the installer on your native OS. Install the application.
5. Launch the application from your Start Menu or Applications folder. It should run as a standalone app, completely independent of your development environment. All features should work.
